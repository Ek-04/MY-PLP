    <h2>INTRO(Do you like poetry?&#x1F92D;coz I doooo!!!&#x1F913;)</h2>
    <P>I am Wangari, a damsel techie!
        Riding on the wings of technology so rocky
        As I trudge in the tapestry of life’s murky,
        I hope that my discipline and strife will not leave me empty.
        <br>
        Hope and faith are so dear to me,
        and gift of friendship is my guiding bridge,
        As I trudge in the tapestry of life’s murky,
        I hope that the connections I’ve made will not be flaky
        <br>
        Dreams and goals are so near to my heart,
        I just pray that they will not leave me hurt
        As I trudge through the tapestry of life’s murky,
        I hope that the aspirations I have will label me lucky!
        
        </P>
